Description: Provides an API to work with 'Redatam' (see <https://redatam.org>) 
  databases in both formats: 'RXDB' (new format) and 'DICX' (old format) and running 
  'Redatam' programs written in 'SPC' language. It's a wrapper around 'Redatam' 
  core and provides functions to open/close a database (redatam_open()/redatam_close()), 
  list entities and variables from the database (redatam_entities(), redatam_variables()) 
  and execute a 'SPC' program and gets the results as data frames 
  (redatam_query(), redatam_run()).
